# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Route planning and stop discovery must produce consistently high-quality, geographically correct results for any destination type.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — ai-quality-stabilization

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: AI quality before UX — wrong geography makes every UI change unreliable
- [Roadmap]: Separate AI quality (Phase 1) from geographic routing (Phase 2) — different problem domains
- [Roadmap]: Route editing before layout redesign — edit controls must be designed into the layout from the start
- [Phase 01]: Style enforcement test intentionally RED until Plan 02 adds STIL-REGEL
- [Phase 01]: Plausibility warning is fire-and-forget -- backend proceeds immediately after SSE emission
- [Phase 01]: bearing_degrees() added to maps_helper.py as reusable utility for direction calculations
- [Phase 01]: Corridor check flags but does NOT reject stops (D-04) -- user sees warning badge
- [Phase 01]: Quality validation uses two-tier Google Places check (find_place_from_text then nearby_search)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Ferry port lookup data needs validation against actual Google Directions behavior for specific routes
- [Research]: Redis optimistic locking pattern needs spike before Phase 3 route editing
- [Research]: CSS Container Queries browser support on iOS Safari needs verification before Phase 4
